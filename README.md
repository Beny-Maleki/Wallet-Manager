# Waller Manager

## Description
This is a simple project in which I have implemented the logic of increasing and decreasing balance of a wallet.
There is also a log storage of transactions implemented by elasticsearch.

## Goal
My main goal in this project was learning Kotlin language with a focus on Spring framework.
I have set up and started working with redis, kafka, and elasticsearch for the first time :D
