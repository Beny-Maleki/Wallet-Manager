# Wallet Manager

## Description
This is a simple project in which I have implemented the logic of increasing and decreasing balance of a wallet.
There is also a log storage of transactions implemented by elasticsearch.

## Goal
My main goal in this project was learning Kotlin language with a focus on Spring framework.
This was my first experience in developing a pattern-based, framework-enabled, backend web project.
I was able to set up and learn Kafka and Elasticsearch for the first time :D
